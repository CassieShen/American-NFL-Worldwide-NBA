					<div style="text-align:left;line-height:25px;width:100%;margin:10px 0;">Last Sunday, February 4th, Super Bowl LII was held in Minneapolis, United State, with Philadelphia Eagles winning the championship of the 2017 season of the National Football League (NFL). </div>
          <div style="text-align:left;line-height:25px;width:100%;margin:10px 0;">The Super Bowl is always the most-watched American television broadcast and is also among the most-watched sporting events in the world, while the National Basketball Associate (NBA) is another major league that arouse wide pubic attention.</div>
          <div style="text-align:left;line-height:25px;width:100%;margin:10px 0;">After comparing the frequency of their names being mentioned by New York Times (NYT) in the past 20 years, it is clear that NFL has always got more hits in NYT articles than NBA, which means the American coverages also focus more on NFL.</div>
          <div style="text-align:center;line-height:50px;width:100%;margin:10px 0;font-size:24px;">Two Major American Sports Leagues' Names Mentioned in New York Times (1997-2017)</div>
          <script src="Two Major American Sports Leagues' Names Mentioned in New York Times (1997-2017).js"></script>
					<div style="text-align:left;line-height:25px;width:100%;margin:10px 0;">Before 2005, it seemed that NFL and NBA shared similar hits in NYT. After that NFL’ figure experienced remarkable increase until 2014, while NBA was always remained around 100 with slight fluctuation. Both of NFL and NBA hits went through a decrease in 2013 but saw a dramatic climb in 2016, although the figure of NFL was still nearly double of the NBA’s. The reasons for both league’s hits achieved the peak might be various. As for the 2016 NFL season, neither of the previous season's Super Bowl participants made the playoffs, which was unexpected at that moment. On the other hand, in the 2016 NBA Finals, the Cleveland Cavaliers defeated the Golden State Warriors with 4:3 after trailing three games to one, which was the first time in finals history with such reversion and was widely reported then. </div>

					<div style="text-align:left;line-height:25px;width:100%;margin:10px 0;">On the whole, Oscars receives positive public reflection, while combined with Metoo, the situation changes. All kinds of speeches at this year's award ceremony won nearly 100% of the audience's approval. While Emma Stone, who presented the best director award, seemed to have made a mistake and attracted many Internet users. When introducing the list of candidates, Stone said the phrase “This year's creation of masterpieces and the four men who were nominated, plus a Greta Grevegue” seemed to be a rare actress with female directors, this made some internet users label her as "white feminist". The black and Latino groups also have pointed out that Emma Stone has only men and women in her eyes but forgot other vulnerable groups that lack the right to speak in Hollywood. </div>

Also, “ESPN”, a sports television network that provides the Super Bowl live is repeatedly mentioned. “NBARegularSeason” is most mentioned in NBA related posts which reflects the latest trend of each game.</div>
